# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Random-Forest-Classifier

In this project Random Forest Algorithm has been used which is an example of supervised learning algorithm. This algorithm is composed of simple tree predictors which are each used for prediction and finally the best solution among them is selected. It is mainly used for classification and regression problems. The reason for the selection of Random Forest algorithm for our project are as follows:
1. This algorithm shows high accuracy as compared to other classification algorithms and works well with very large datasets.
2. Several variables can be handled and there is no problem of deletion of variables in case of missing values.
